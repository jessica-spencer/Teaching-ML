# Teaching DS Kit: Predicting Housing Prices

This is a notebook I used for workshops on the Data Science workflow using Jupyter Notebooks in AWS Sagemaker. It's meant to be an introduction to the capabilities of Machine Learning, and the process involved in solving a machine learning problem. 
I have presented it for students, interns, company employees who wanted to learn more, business teams assessing Sagemaker's capabilities, among many others.

It involves 
  - exploratory stats
  - sklearn linear regression
  - Machine Learning using linear regression and a random forest 
  - model evaluation for prediction
